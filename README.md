# Profitable app profile App store and Google Play store
In this project we find out which sort of app will be profitable and successful in both the mobile OS platform. I have given all the description along with the code in python notebook.

**I took Apple's App store data set as well as Google play store data set.**

*I had cleaned both the data sets by:*

 * Removing Wrong data
 * Removing Duplicate data
 * Removing Non English app data
 * Isolating free apps from paid apps ("Here is motive is to analyse free apps only)
 
**Then I have analysed which sort of genre or category of apps are profitable, this done by below method:**

 * First I had analysed Apple's App store, from that result I got to know the popular apps.
 * Then I analysed Google Play store, from that result I found out which sort of apps are profitable.
 
## Note:
